## Lil Markdown Editor

This is a minimal markdown editor. It supports multiple syntaxes and is in a very early stage of development. Written in plain javascript without any libraries. Even the linter is written by myself. Have fun :)

### Usage
Run `npm run build` which creates the JS Files that are required in index.html.
After that, launch index.html in your browser.
